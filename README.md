# Introduction
I am a Graphic Designer and a Computer Engineer too.
I needed a website to showcase my design portfolio and hence I made this website.

Hosting and Domain:

I used github pages for the hosting and used a domain name I had already received from www.porkbun.com. I got this domain for free thanks to https://mlh.io 's HueHacks Hackathon.
Also in order to edit the DNS records, I used the editor provided by Porkbun itself.

I hope you like it :)
